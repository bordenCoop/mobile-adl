  <h1>Web-based Virtual Worlds and Simulation (VWs)</h1>
  Research into the emerging fields of serious games, simulations, and virtual reality (within a distributed learning context)
  for the purpose of providing rich interactive content, delivered to remote learners, allowing these learners to exercise skills that
  are either too costly, complex, or dangerous to practice in real life.
    <br/>  <br/>
  Learn about all 3 of the VR/AR devices. We have the Microsoft Hololens, Oculus Rift, and the HTC Vive. Each device has it's own introduction
  activity that you should complete first to learn how to use the device. Afterwards you can go through the rest of the activities. Make sure to answer
  the questions in the comment box after you have completed each activity.
