  <h2>Welcome to the Advanced Distributed Learning group!</h2>
  <p>
    e-Learning (web-based learning) – Research technical components and techniques to develop and support electronic-based education and training.
    This includes R&D on the creation, delivery, and tracking of web-based learning content in a consistent and interoperable way;
     best practices for e-learning policy and processes; and various components for supporting web-based learning, such as content and learning management systems, content registries, and Massive Open Online Courses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mobile learning and mobile performance support – Research focused on the use of commercially-available handheld computing devices to provide
    access to learning content and information resources by leveraging ubiquitous mobile technology for the adoption or augmentation of
    knowledge, behaviors, or skills through education, training, or performance support.
  </p>
  <p>
    Learning analytics and performance modeling – Research in the collection, measurement, analysis, and reporting of data, which may include
    “big data,” about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding, optimizing, and predicting learning success.
    Other topics under this category may include competencies, credentialing, learner profiles, data visualization, open/social learner models, and associated privacy and information security concerns.
  </p>
  <p>
    Learning theory – Research focused on the application, evaluation, and embedding of efficient and effective, current, new, and emerging
    theories of learning, learning science, instructional technology, and tutoring to the design, prototyping, and evaluation of
    primarily digital learning technologies. This research is pervasive, touching all aspects of research and development performed by ADL.
  </p>
  <p>
    Total Learning Architecture infrastructure (TLA) – Research focused on modernizing the platforms used for education and training, to
    interoperability of disparate systems so they can be used together as a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to
     securely share relevant learning data including, but not limited to, granular learning experience information, competency frameworks, learner profiles and metadata about learning and training content.
  </p>
  <p>
    Web-based Virtual Worlds and simulation (VWs) – Research into the emerging fields of serious games, simulations, and virtual reality
    (within a distributed learning context) for the purpose of providing rich interactive content, delivered to remote
    learners, allowing these learners to exercise skills that are either too costly, complex, or dangerous to practice in real life.
